# Random Number Generator
My first Android app, where I've built a very simple Random Number Generator application. You set the upper bound for the random number generation in the seek bar, and upon clicking the button, a random number between 1 and the upper bound specified is generated and displayed on the screen.

## Supported devices
All Android devices running Android 5.0 Lollipop and above are supported.
